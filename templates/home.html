        Hi I'm Mason. I'm a guy who is often on the computer. I find it quite enjoyable!
    </div>
    <div>
        I love to make things! Mostly with code, but sometimes with other things, like words or sounds or wires.
        I've been coding for a long time as a hobby; mostly hacking Nintendo consoles,learning algorithms, and making
        tools for music.
        I did my grad school research <a
            href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=blockchain,crypto&hl=en">when crypto was
        at its hype peak</a>, and I wrote a lot about contemporary philosophy and blockchain mathematics. Sometimes I
        post
        stuff like that over on <a href="/blog">the blog</a>, but I put stuff up and take it down a lot.

        I didn't go to engineering school like I probably should have because I was 18 and attempting to build an
        ill-fated career as a jazz musician. It was fun! Through a long series of coincidences and happenstance,
        I ended up with a philosophy scholarship to the University of London's Paris Institute and a management
        position at a local language school. That was also pretty fun! But after all that, I honestly just missed my
        computer and wanted to come back to it. And so I did, and now I'm here!
